# ACT-SAT-Participation-Machine-Learning-Python

This project was created for comparative analysis of ACT (https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows) and SAT (https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent) participation and scores.

I took two datasets: ACT and SAT average grades by state and their participation for 2017.

I did some explanatory data analysis. As a result:
- There is reverse relationship between average score and participation for both of exams. That means that if an exam is optional (so, it has low participation) only best students take it. 
- There is no "strong" or "weak" state, average score depends on participation.
- The less students passed SAT, the more students passed ACT, and vice versa.
- It is possible to identify the weakest subject in each state.
